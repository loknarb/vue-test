# Create a small fictitious app that contains a map with one of the mapbox examples (no functionality needed)

Add some components somewhere on the view (not in the map). For example a menu to switch some states. Must not be connected to the map. Maybe a List Menu from vuetify for example. You are totally free of what else is included and it must have not any functionality.
